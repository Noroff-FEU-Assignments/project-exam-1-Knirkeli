# Trollmagi

Trollmagi is a blog about the Norwegian folklore creature "Troll". It was created as a year one exam project using HTML, CSS, JS and PHP. The data for the blog was fetched from a WP API using the WP REST API.

The theme of the blog was inspired by the stories I tell my kids before bed. Check it out to learn more about the fascinating world of Norwegian folklore!
